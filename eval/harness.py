"""
eval/harness.py — runs the task set against a live Agent and scores each result.

Scoring logic lives here, separate from the task DEFINITIONS (tasks.py) and
separate from agent internals (agent.py). This separation matters: you
could point this exact harness at a completely different agent
implementation (a fine-tuned model, a different framework) and get
directly comparable numbers, because the scoring rules don't know or care
how the agent produced its trace — only what the trace contains.
